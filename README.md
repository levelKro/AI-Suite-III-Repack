For unknown reason, Asus release AI Suite III without all programs, and some times, one of them don't work correctly, few times is renamed, or use another core system.

This is an All In One and Updated version of the AI Suite III from Asus (one install for all).

## Where are the FanXpert 2 or Performance and Saving Utilities ?
The Performance and Power Saving Utilities (PPSU) and FanXpert 2 (FX2) are a version of Dual Intelligent Processor (DIP) module. I have removed the PPSU and FX2 for this reason. Installing one of this module with another make AI Suite error and modules can't be used. This pack offer to you the most complete features of this modules.

* Microsoft Windows 10 X64, can be working on Windows 7/8/8.1 X64 also.
* Tested with AMD Ryzen processor, but no reason to not work on another if AI Suite III is supported.
* Test on Asus B350-Prime Plus motherboard (can work with others Asus mainboards, if AI Suite III is already supported).
